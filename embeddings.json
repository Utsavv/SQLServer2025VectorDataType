    "DocumentText": "The 'Container' condition in the Rule Engine allows users to group multiple conditions together. Actions can then be created that reference the entire container, making it easier to manage complex rules. This is especially useful in scenarios like partner-product promotions where multiple conditions need to be evaluated together.\nThe Rule Builder allows users to create, modify, and manage business rules.\nYou can add new actions by using the Rule Builder.\nTo modify an existing rule, use the edit button available on the Rule Builder page.\nUse the 'Halt rule execution' action to stop further evaluation of rules.\nTo create a new rule, use the Rule Builder.\nThe key components of a rule in the Rule Engine are conditions and actions. Conditions are the criteria that must be true for the actions to execute. Actions are the tasks that are performed once the conditions are met. Each rule can consist of multiple conditions and actions to implement complex business logic.\nThe Rule Engine includes several 'Out of the Box' conditions by default, such as 'Rule executed,' 'Group,' and 'Container.' The 'Rule executed' condition allows for the creation of dependencies between rules. The 'Group' condition helps in changing logical operators between rules from AND to OR, and the 'Container' condition allows grouping other conditions to reference them collectively.\nCustom conditions in the Rule Engine allow users to define new criteria that can be used to create business rules beyond the default set. These custom conditions can be created in the Rule Builder, enabling users to handle unique business requirements that are not covered by 'Out of the Box' conditions.\nThe Rule Engine provides some 'Out of the Box' actions, such as the 'Halt rule execution' action. This action can be used to stop the evaluation of lower-priority rules once certain conditions have been met. Users can also define their own custom actions to meet specific business needs.\nThe Rule Builder is a tool within the Rule Engine that allows users to create, modify, and manage business rules. Users can define both conditions and actions to create complex decision-making logic. The Rule Builder supports both 'Out of the Box' and custom conditions and actions, providing flexibility in implementing business rules.\nThe Rule Engine handles rule dependencies using the 'Rule executed' condition. This condition allows users to define dependencies between different rules. For example, users can specify that a particular rule (e.g., rule B) can only execute if another rule (e.g., rule A) has not fired. This feature ensures that rules are executed in the desired sequence based on the dependencies defined.\nThe 'Group' condition in the Rule Engine allows users to change the logical operator between conditions from the default AND to OR. This provides more flexibility in how conditions are evaluated within a rule, allowing users to create more sophisticated and varied decision-making criteria.\nYes, users can create custom actions in the Rule Engine using the Rule Builder. Custom actions allow users to define specific tasks that are executed when conditions are met. This flexibility is important for addressing unique business requirements that may not be covered by the default actions.\nThe data model for actions and conditions in the Rule Engine presents the relationship between different components of a rule. It provides detailed information about the parameters required for rule condition definitions and rule action definitions. This helps users understand how conditions and actions interact and how to effectively configure them for their business logic.\nTo stop the evaluation of rules in the Rule Engine, you can use the 'Halt rule execution' action. This action prevents any lower-priority rules from being evaluated once certain conditions are met, ensuring that subsequent actions are not executed.\nYes, in the Rule Engine, you can change the default logical operator between conditions from AND to OR by using the 'Group' condition. This allows for greater flexibility in specifying how different conditions are combined within a rule.\nTo create partner-product promotions in the Rule Engine, you can use the 'Container' condition to group multiple relevant conditions together. Actions can then be defined that apply to the entire group of conditions, making it easier to manage complex promotional rules.\nCustom conditions and actions in the Rule Engine allow users to define specific criteria and tasks that are not available by default. This enables users to implement unique business logic that is tailored to their specific needs, making the Rule Engine highly adaptable.\nRules in the Rule Engine are executed sequentially based on dependencies defined using the 'Rule executed' condition. This condition helps users specify when a particular rule should execute in relation to others, ensuring the correct sequence of actions.\nExamples of 'Out of the Box' conditions in the Rule Engine include 'Rule executed,' which manages dependencies between rules, 'Group,' which changes the logical operator between conditions, and 'Container,' which allows multiple conditions to be grouped together for ease of management.\nTo create a new rule using the Rule Builder, you need to define the conditions that must be met and the actions that should be executed once those conditions are satisfied. The Rule Builder provides tools to use both 'Out of the Box' and custom conditions and actions, enabling the creation of complex decision logic.\nThe 'Rule executed' condition in the Rule Engine allows users to create dependencies between rules. It specifies whether a particular rule can fire based on whether another rule has or has not been executed, which helps in managing the sequence of rule execution.\nCustom actions improve the Rule Engine's functionality by allowing users to define specific tasks that align with unique business requirements. This flexibility ensures that the Rule Engine can address scenarios not covered by the default actions, providing more tailored decision-making capabilities.\nThe data model in the Rule Engine is significant because it helps users understand the relationships between conditions and actions, as well as the parameters required for defining these components. This understanding is crucial for configuring rules effectively and ensuring they perform as intended.\nevery rule has two parts: conditions and actions. In addition to a number of default conditions and actions, you can create custom conditions and actions.",
